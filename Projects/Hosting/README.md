# Project 1 - DIY HTTPS Server

## Objectives
- set up a webserver to host content
- enable and configure HTTPS
- enable and modify firewall rules for better security

## What you need
- a website (nothing fancy, although it breaks up grading monotony)
- an AWS instance
- course GitHub repository (for project documentation deliverables)
    - looks like `https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/ceg2410-projects-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME`

## Part 1 - HTTP Server

1. Install either **Apache HTTP Server** OR **Nginx** to your instance.  Document the following:
    - What port is the service running on?
    - What directory does it serve content from by default?
    - What is the name of the primary configuration file for the service?
2. Host your content via the web server.  
    - Describe two ways (at least) that you can confirm the webserver is serving your site's content
3. Set appropriate access.  Ensure the following:
    - the content server can read the site files
    - members of a group named `devs` are allowed to edit and create new files
        - this should persist for new content created within the site folder - new things created should also be modifiable by members of `dev`
    - in your documentation include:
        - a screenshot of your permission sets
        - a description of how you set up the permissions (especially the persistence)
        - [Resource hint 1](https://linuxize.com/post/understanding-linux-file-permissions/)
        - [Resource hint 2](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-user-to-group-in-linux/)

**NOTE: IF YOU DO NOT COMPLETE ENABLING HTTPS, INCLUDE SCREENSHOT OF SITE RUNNING WITH HTTP**

## Part 2 - Enable HTTPS 

1. Create a self-signed TLS certificate for your server
2. Enable HTTPS for your web content service
    - Redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS
    - Restart the web content service
3. Document:
    - Configuration file changes
    - Location of certificate files
    - Administrative commands (like how to restart the web content service)
    - How you can confirm HTTPS is enabled
4. Include screenshot of site after HTTPS is enabled

Note: configuring your web browser to trust the cert is optional

## Part 3 - Firewall Fixes (Easy Mode)

We are using an instance hosted on AWS for this project.  The firewall rules for this instance have ALL ports open within the private network the instance is on, AND ALL ports from any source  (0.0.0.0/0).  Your task in this part is to fix the Security Groups associated with this instance.  

Go to the Learner Lab page, make sure "Start Lab" turned things on, then click the AWS link.  Now go to EC2 -> Security Groups.  You'll see one labeled something like: `ceg2350-Lab1SecurityGroup`

Create 2 rules for SSH:
- allow SSH connections from your home (and any additional trusted sources)
- allow SSH connections from campus (130.108.0.0/16)

Create 2 rules for HTTP/ HTTPS
- allow HTTP from any source
- allow HTTPS from any source

Remove any other rules that are too open.

Your deliverable for this part is a brief explanation of the rules created AND a screenshot of your rules.

## Firewall Fixes - HARD MODE - 10% Extra Credit

Use either `ufw` or `iptables` to generate to the following firewall rules.  Move carefully and understand chaining (before you lock yourself out... forever!)

Create 2 rules for SSH:
- allow SSH connections from your home (and any additional trusted sources)
- allow SSH connections from campus (130.108.0.0/16)

Create 2 rules for HTTP/ HTTPS
- allow HTTP from any source
- allow HTTPS from any source

Remove any other rules that are too open.

## Part 4 - Research

1. Domain name registration
    - Select a registrar you would use to register a domain name
    - Describe what steps would be needed to associate the domain name with your web server
2. Certificate Authority Validation
    - Select a CA you would use to validate your site & generate a certificate
    - Describe what is needed for validation

## Part 5 - Resources Used

This does not need to be in it's own section, but you should document what resources you used.  This does not need to be fancy.  You can [link in line to xkcd](https://xkcd.com/), or just list links
- https://xkcd.com/

or my favorite, give a bit of a title and what's inside
- [xkcd - comic of the day](https://xkcd.com/)

## Submission

- In the Pilot Dropbox, paste the URL to the your Project 1 folder in your GitHub repo
  - URL should look like: https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/ceg2410-projects-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/tree/main/Project1
