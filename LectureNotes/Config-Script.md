## Config Script

Setting up a new Linux environment to be how you want when you sign on is repetitive - so let's make a script! If using an AWS instance, install things relative to being the ubuntu user (or create a new user if you'd like).  WSL2 should also be a good place to fidget.

When scripting, it is recommended to try things in the terminal before creating a script using those commands.

Write a script (choice of bash, python, or Powershell) that does the following:

1. Installs packages: git, vim, python3, plus one of choice

    - [Check for `root` / `sudo`](https://askubuntu.com/questions/519/how-do-i-write-a-shell-script-to-install-a-list-of-applications)
2. Customizes vim: add color scheme, change default colorization, add functionality with plugin of choice
    - If you choose to install a `vim` plugin manager, add comments to link to how to install it
    - Colorization - download color scheme and enable it:

    - Other `vim` plugins - download plugin and enable it:

3. Make a function for package installs and a function for your `vim` customizations, and a driver function that calls both.

4. (Bonus) Copies an `authorized_keys` file to `~/.ssh/`

    - Hint: I recommend adding an `authorized_keys` file to your repository, then copying it to the correct location
        - Safety hint - maybe think about **appending** it to the existing one? [How to Combine Text Files Using the `cat` Command in Linux](https://www.howtogeek.com/278599/how-to-combine-text-files-using-the-cat-command-in-linux/)
