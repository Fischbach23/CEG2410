# AWS CLI

Some AWs actions & tests will require or recommend use of the AWS Command Line Interface tools.  These can be installed for Linux or Powershell.

Since we have education accounts, our ability to get IAM credentials is limited, so to use the CLI tools, use the terminal presented in the browser after selecting "Start Lab"
