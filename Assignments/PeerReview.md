## Peer review

Your task is to review a classmates dotfiles collection.  You will provide feedback by generating Issues in their repository.

## Types of Issues

1. Missing features.
    - Review [assignment requirements](https://github.com/pattonsgirl/CEG2410/blob/main/Assignments/BYOE.md) and check that their collection has a minimum of the requirements.  Note anything missing in an Issue
2. Organization feedback.
    - Common organization issues can include
        - Lack of repository documentation - no README.md defining what the collection does or how it is organized
        - No folder organization.  Sure, it made pathing easier in the script, but no one likes to look at a dump of files
3. Logic / structure feedback.
   - Everything is in one monolithic script.  As we discussed, this can make challenges if you need to setup what you can without root priveleges - what if you just want to set up your user account!
   - Lack of script comments or output statements to explain to users what is happening as the script runs
   - Conditions worth checking.  As we disucssed, sometimes your script should ask before auto-doing a task.  This can include yes/no questions of doing an action, or existence conditions like specific directories

## Submission
