# News Watch

Each of you during this semester are going to post a technical article of interest.  But not all at once.

## Post Rules

One person per post day.  Post days are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  Article should include background information needed for understanding or you will need to include additional articles.

Article topics:
- something new (to you or to the field)
- something hacked
- something vulnerable
- something patched / updated

I recommend keeping an eye on:
- Hacker News
- Bleeping Computer
- Ars Technica
- PCWorld
- TechCrunch
- 9to5google
- 9to5mac / MacWorld

## Post Submission

Post article, a brief summary (and any supporting articles) to our course Discord channel.  If your Discord username is not your real name, email me to claim completion of this assignment.

If someone has already posted an article on a given day, save yours for next round.
